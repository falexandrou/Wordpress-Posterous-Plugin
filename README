Integration of your Posterous into Wordpress without importing (mostly) for those using Wordpress as a CMS

== Description ==

This plugin integrates your posterous plugin into your Wordpress installation. Requires that you create a page 
that is going to represent the "blog" (posterous) section. Useful for people (like me) who use Wordpress as a 
CMS and want their blog on Posterous (mine is http://fotis.posterous.com)

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload zip contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Copy the code inside `blog.php` into the page that represents the blog
4. (Optional) Chmod 777 file /wp-content/plugins/posterous/cookie.txt

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin import data into wordpress? =

No, it's just an integration which means that data are load upon each request directly from posterous

= I get errors about something called CURL. Now what?  =

This probably means you don't have the cURL extension loaded into your PHP installation. Please contact your system administrator.

= Where can i reach you?  =

You can reach me at fotis@redmark.gr anytime ;)
